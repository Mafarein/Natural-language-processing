# NLP - Clustering newsgroup clustering

The project, undertaken by a team of two, involved data preprocessing, visualizing textual data using the t-SNE technique and applying various clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering.

## About dataset

The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. 
It was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. 
The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.
